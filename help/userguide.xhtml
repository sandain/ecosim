      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>
        The motivation and theory for Ecotype Simulation may be found in our
        recent paper in PNAS by
        <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0712205105v1">

      Ecotype Simulation models the sequence diversity within a
      bacterial clade as the evolutionary result of net ecotype
      formation (here termed omega) and periodic selection (termed
      sigma), yielding a certain number of ecotypes (termed npop).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ecotype Simulation determines the rates omega and sigma,
      and most importantly, the number of putative ecotypes (npop)
      represented in an investigated set of sequences. Ecotype
      Simulation also allows demarcation of the sequences belonging
      to each ecotype. Here is an overview.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first step, the <a href="#simulation">Ecotype Simulation</a>, the
      observed sequence diversity for the clade of interest is quantified as
      the &quot;clade sequence diversity curve.&quot; Then, the parameters
      omega, sigma, and npop are estimated by fitting lines to the observed
      clade sequence diversity pattern. Next, the downhill simplex method
      (termed here &quot;hillclimbing&quot;) is used to more precisely
      identify the solution. In this first step, Ecotype Simulation also
      determines the 95% confidence interval of the parameter solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second step, <a href="#demarcation">Ecotype Demarcation</a>,
      Ecotype Simulation demarcates the individual sequences belonging to each
      ecotype.

      Requirements
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before you can run this program, you must have the latest version of the
      Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. You can do so by navigating to
      the <a href= "http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java
      download page</a> and downloading the latest update (you will need at
      least Java 8 to get the program to run properly).

      How to use Ecotype Simulation
    </h3>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>
        To run the Ecotype Simulation, first open up a properly formatted
        Fasta file in the Java Window by going to File-&gt;Open Sequence File.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>
        Note that the fasta input file must contain an outgroup, and
        that <strong>the outgroup must be the first sequence in the
        file</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>
        Once a Fasta file has been loaded, the program will ask you to either
        provide a properly formatted Newick tree or generate one using
        <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">FastTree</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>
        If you choose to provide your own Newick tree, it must contain the
        same sequence identifiers as the Fasta file and provide distance data.
        The Newick tree may also contain boostrap data, but this information
        is not used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>
        With the Fasta and Newick files loaded, the program will automatically
        estimate the parameter values for omega, sigma, and npop.
      </li>
      <li>
        To optimize the estimated parameter values for omega, sigma, and npop,
        and prepare for later stages, click &quot;Run Hillclimbing&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many combinations of parameter values are evaluated for the fraction
        of replicate runs that yield a close fit to the observed clade
        sequence diversity curve (e.g., as seen in Figure 1 of Koeppel et al.;
        this curve represents, for each of a series of sequence identity
        criteria, the number of sequence identity bins required to encompass
        all the sequences from the clade; also see description below &quot;How 
        the Ecotype Simulation works&quot;). For a given replicate run, a
        successfully close fit to the observed diversity curve is defined as
        being within a chosen &quot;precision factor.&quot; For example, in
        our analyses of <i>Bacillus simplex</i>, a replicate run was deemed
        successful if the simulation's number of bins for each sequence
        identity criterion was within a factor of 1.5 of the observed value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>
        Once you have parameter values for a set of sequences, you can save a
        progress file by going to File-&gt;Save Project File. The results will
        be saved in a *.xml file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, you can click &quot;Run Confidence Intervals&quot; to find the
        95% confidence interval for the parameter estimate.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>
        Alternatively, if you click on &quot;Run Everything&quot; the program
        will calculate both parameter values and confidence intervals for all
        parameters, and automatically demarcate ecotypes without any further
        input.

      How the Ecotype Simulation works.

    <p>
      We strongly recommend that you read this section, as it will
      help you to use Ecotype Simulation with understanding and not
      as a black-box method.

        sequence diversity curve.

    </ul>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>
        Once you have opened properly formatted Fasta and Newick files, the
        program automatically quantifies the sequence diversity in the
        observed sequence set by running a complete-linkage binning algorithm
        on the clade structure (see Figure 3 below). The sequence diversity
        is clustered into bins at different sequence identity criteria. For
        example, a bin at a given sequence identity criterion, e.g., 95%
        sequence identity, is characterized by encompassing only those
        sequences which have at least a sequence identity of 95%.
        <br/>
        We exemplify this with the subclade of the Putative Ecotypes
        2, 3, and 4 from the <em>Bacillus subtilis-B. licheniformis</em>
        clade (Figure 3a from the PNAS paper Koeppel et al) (see below).
        <br/>
        At a sequence identity criterion of 0.995 three different
        bins are present, represented by Putative Ecotypes 2, 3, and 4. At a
        sequence identity criterion of 0.99, two different bins are
        present, represented by Putative Ecotype 4 and the pool of Putative 
        Ecotypes 2 and 3. At a sequence identity criterion of 0.98 only one
        bin is present, encompassing Putative Ecotypes 2-4. In that way, for a
        series of different sequence identity criteria, the numbers of bins is
        determined and graphically represented.
        <br/>
        <strong>As a result, the clade sequence diversity curve is created

        After the observed clade sequence diversity curve is calculated, the
        values for omega, sigma, and npop are estimated using an algorithm
        inspired by the k-means clustering algorithm. However, instead of
        slurping up points into a cluster around a k points, the pivots,
        this algorithm slurps up points along the sequence diversity curve
        that are closest to one of two lines who's slope will define sigma
        and omega. The algorithm starts by seeding the &quot;sigma line&quot;
        with the first two points along the sequence diversity curve (ignoring
        1.00). Any points along the curve that are close to the &quot;sigma
        line&quot; (with a squared distance from the line &lt;0.1) are slurped
        up into a prototype &quot;sigma cluster&quot;. The same process is
        repeated to seed the &quot;omega line&quot;, but starting with the
        next two points along the sequence diversity curve not already in the
        &quot;sigma cluster&quot;. Once the two prototype clusters are defined
        the algorithm proceeds in k-means fashion, alternating between
        calculating best fit lines (as the pivots) for the two clusters then
        calculating the closest line for each point along the sequence
        diversity curve. The algorithm proceeds until the best fit for both
        lines has been achieved, based on the sum of squared distances of each
        point from its line.
        <br/>
        Once the optimal solution has been found, sigma is estimated from the
        slope of the &quot;sigma line&quot;, omega is estimated from the slope
        of the &quot;omega line&quot;, and npop is estimated by calculating
        the number of bins at the intersection of the two lines (see Figure
        2).

        The estimated parameters are then tested more fully (i.e., with 10000
        replicates), so as to get a good estimate of the approximate
        likelihood of this solution producing a successful match to the
        observed data. The likelihood is first calculated for the 1.50x
        precision value and reduced from there if needed (i.e., 2x, 5x).

        Next are the confidence intervals. Omega and sigma
        confidence intervals are run to a lower bound of 1e-7 and an
        upper bound of 100, with 6 increments per order of magnitude.
        If sigma runs up to 100 without getting out of confidence we
        just say that sigma exceeds 100. Drift is run from infinity
        down to 1e-7 with 3 increments per order of magnitude, and
        then the final value is inverted to get the actual drift
        value. The npop confidence interval is run down to 1 for the
        lower bound and up to the number of sequences for the upper
        bound. The last value still in confidence is reported in all
        cases. Additionally, the program aims for 20 successes at the
        threshold likelihood, ie for all two tailed tests (npop,
        sigma, omega) it is the likelihood from our hillclimbing
        parameters divided by 6.83, and for one tailed tests we
        divide by 3.87.

        Ecotype Demarcation works by examining each branch of the phylogeny to
        determine if the most likely npop value for just that branch is equal
        to one or more than one.  When a branch with a most likely npop value
